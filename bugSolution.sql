Several strategies can mitigate the issue:

1. **Check the row count:** Before executing the `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` query, execute a separate query to determine the total number of rows and ensure that the `OFFSET` value is not greater than this count.

2. **Use window functions (if supported):** Window functions often provide a more efficient way to retrieve paged data.  For instance, `ROW_NUMBER()` can assign a unique rank to each row, enabling you to filter for specific ranges.

3. **Employ database-specific features:** Some databases offer optimized methods for handling pagination.  Consult the documentation for your database system for any specialized functions or features.

```sql
-- Improved query to handle potential incomplete pages
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM large_table; --check total rows before fetching the page

-- Example using window function (ROW_NUMBER) if supported by your database
WITH RankedRows AS (
  SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY some_column) as rn
  FROM large_table
)
SELECT * FROM RankedRows WHERE rn BETWEEN 1001 AND 200; 
```

This approach ensures that the application is aware of the number of rows returned and can handle cases where a full page of data is not available.
